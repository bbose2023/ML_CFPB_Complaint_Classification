## Objective

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a 21st century agency that implements and enforces Federal consumer financial law and ensures that markets for consumer financial products are fair, transparent, and competitive.

Each week thousands of consumer complaints about financial products and services are sent to respective companies for response. Data from those complaints helps CFPB understand the financial marketplace and protect consumers. This ever-growing CFPB Complaint Database
is publicly avaiable and offers a rich resource for understanding consumer experiences in the financial marketplace.

Our project will provide prediction platform leveraging machine learning to analyze the extensive Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Complaint Database, a publicly
available resource exceeding 4.9 GB in size.

The platform will utilize the machine learning models to classify consumer complaints text into these categories: Debt collection, Consumer Loan, Mortgage, Credit card, Credit reporting, Student loan, Bank account or service, Payday loan, Money transfers, Other financial service, Prepaid card.

## Specifications

CFPB publish complaints after the company responds or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Here's the information provided in the published report.

## Workflow

## Data Challenges and Preprocessing Techniques

* Imbalanced Data:

        Problem: Class imbalance where some classes are underrepresented can cause the model to be biased towards the majority class.

        Solution: Techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), undersampling, or using class weights in the model can help balance the data.
* Large Dataset

* Preprocessing Techniques:
        Text Cleaning:

        Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.

        Stop Word Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to the meaning (e.g., "and", "the").

        Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run").

* Feature Extraction:

        TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighs the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across all documents.

* Encoding Categorical Variables:

        Tokenization: Converts categorical variables into binary vectors.

        Label Encoding: Assigns a unique integer to each category.

## Conclusion
<ol>
<li> Challenges: Data Imbalance: Addressed class imbalance issues using techniques like oversampling and class weights.

<li>Feature Selection: Managed high-dimensional data by selecting relevant features and applying dimensionality reduction techniques.

<li>Model Complexity: Balanced model complexity and computational efficiency to ensure robust performance.
</ol>

## Future Work:

Multi-Class Classification: Expand the model to classify text data into multiple categories (e.g., 12 products) instead of binary classification.

Advanced Models: Explore advanced models such as transformers (BERT, GPT) for better performance and deeper insights.

Explainability: Integrate explainability techniques to understand and interpret model decisions, making the system more transparent and trustworthy.

Overall, this project showcases the power of combining NLP, supervised models, and deep learning to automate text classification and generate valuable insights from large volumes of text data. By continuously refining and expanding the model, we can achieve even greater accuracy and applicability, driving significant improvements in various domains.
